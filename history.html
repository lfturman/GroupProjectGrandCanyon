        <h2>Geological Formation</h2>
        <p>
          The Grand Canyon is a geological marvel, carved by the mighty Colorado
          River over <strong>5 to 6 million years</strong>. The canyon walls
          expose layers of rock that trace nearly
          <strong>two billion years</strong> of Earth's history, offering
          geologists a unique cross-section of the Earth's crust.

        <h2>Native American Presence</h2>
        <p>
          Humans have inhabited the region for more than
          <strong>12,000 years</strong>, with archaeological evidence including
          spear points from Paleo-Indians and intricate split-twig figurines
          found in canyon caves. Numerous Native American tribes have historic
          and cultural ties to the canyon, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ancestral Puebloans:</strong> Flourished in the area,
            developing agriculture and building stone dwellings (pueblos) before
            leaving due to a prolonged drought in the 13th century.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Havasupai:</strong> Known as the "people of the blue-green
            waters," they have lived in the canyon for at least 800 years and
            continue to reside in the village of Supai.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Navajo, Hualapai, and Southern Paiute:</strong> These tribes
            also have deep historical connections and communities along the
            canyon's edges.

        <h2>European Exploration and Park Status</h2>
        <p>
          The first Europeans to reach the Grand Canyon were Spanish explorers
          in the 1540s, guided by Hopi people. However, it wasn't until U.S.
          Army Major John Wesley Powell led the first successful river
          expedition through the canyon in 1869 that the area gained significant
          scientific and national attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early settlers initially sought mineral resources like copper, but
          tourism soon proved more profitable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1893:</strong> President Benjamin Harrison first protected
            the canyon as a forest reserve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1908:</strong> President Theodore Roosevelt designated it a
            national monument to preserve its grandeur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1919:</strong> The Grand Canyon was officially established
            as a National Park by an Act of Congress signed by President Woodrow
            Wilson.
