            <div class="faq-question">How deep is the Grand Canyon?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The Grand Canyon is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) deep at its
                deepest point. The average depth is about 1 mile, with the
                canyon stretching 277 miles long and up to 18 miles wide.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How old is the Grand Canyon?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon are nearly 2 billion
                years old, but the canyon itself was carved by the Colorado
                River over the past 5 to 6 million years.

              Which rim should I visit - North or South?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The South Rim is open year-round and is the most visited, with
                more facilities and viewpoints. The North Rim is higher in
                elevation, less crowded, and offers a different perspective, but
                is only open mid-May through mid-October due to snow.

          <h3>Planning Your Visit</h3>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is the best time to visit?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) offer the best
                weather with mild temperatures and fewer crowds. Summer can be
                very hot and crowded, while winter offers fewer visitors but
                cold temperatures and possible snow.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How much does it cost to enter?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The entrance fee is $35 per vehicle for a 7-day pass, $30 per
                motorcycle, or $20 per person for those entering on foot or
                bicycle. An annual pass costs $70.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How long should I plan to visit?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                For a first visit to the South Rim, plan at least one full day.
                Two to three days allows time for hiking, watching
                sunrise/sunset, and exploring multiple viewpoints. If you want
                to hike to the bottom or visit both rims, plan 4-5 days.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Do I need reservations?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                You don't need reservations to enter the park, but lodging
                inside the park should be booked 6-12 months in advance,
                especially for summer. Backcountry camping permits require
                reservations and can be obtained up to 4 months in advance.

          <h3>Hiking & Safety</h3>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
              Can I hike to the bottom and back in one day?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The National Park Service strongly discourages hiking to the
                river and back in one day. It's extremely strenuous (16-19 miles
                round trip with significant elevation change) and dangerous,
                especially in summer. Many experienced hikers have required
                rescue attempting this.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What should I bring for a day hike?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Bring plenty of water (at least 1 liter per 2 hours of hiking),
                salty snacks, sun protection (hat, sunscreen, sunglasses), a
                first aid kit, and a map. Wear sturdy hiking boots and layers of
                clothing. Start early to avoid afternoon heat.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Are there guardrails everywhere?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                No. While major viewpoints have railings, many areas along the
                rim do not. Stay on designated trails and at least 6 feet from
                the edge. Deaths from falls occur every year, so always be
                cautious and supervise children closely.

            <div class="faq-question">What animals might I see?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Common wildlife includes mule deer, elk, California condors,
                ravens, squirrels, and various lizards. Mountain lions and
                rattlesnakes are present but rarely seen. Never feed or approach
                wildlife, and maintain a safe distance.

            <div class="faq-question">Is altitude a concern?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The South Rim sits at 7,000 feet elevation and the North Rim at
                8,000 feet. Some visitors may experience mild altitude sickness.
                Stay hydrated, take it easy the first day, and be aware of
                symptoms like headache, nausea, or dizziness.
